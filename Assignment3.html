        <li><strong><em>Phạm Lê Việt An – s4065605</em></strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>My name is An. I was born in Can Tho city in 2002 and for more than 18 years, I have been living and studying in Ho Chi Minh city. I graduated high school in 2020 and I spent the next 3 years studying Mechanical Engineering in Taiwan. Even though Vietnamese is my mother tongue, I am confident in my English skill (evident in my latest IELTS test I got 7.5 overall bands) and I can work and study comfortably in any international environment. I come from a family with engineering tradition, most of my older cousins work at engineer – relative jobs and my father is a biology engineer working for Vinh Thinh Biostadt, a food company that focuses on research and producing food and medicine for aquaculture. Because of my unique background, I have had a good understanding of Engineering since a young age. 
        My interest in IT began during my study in Taiwan 1 year ago, when I was researching my Special topic for graduation, I found out about the situation of the Vietnamese farmers. Apparently, the aquaculture of Vietnam is still very primitive, most of the farmers still using their personal experience of estimating and providing the medicine and food for their grow-out ponds, we still do not have the tool to give accurate information about the aquaculture milieu to provide the right amount of aquafeed and medicine. This led to a very infective farming method and often resulted in loss of fishes and crayfishes due to diseases. Knowing that, I consulted my father and we came up with an idea to create an information system that can automatically detect the chemicals in the pond, filter important information, send it back to the farmers and provide appropriate guidance to the farmer on feeding and maintaining their farm. Since then, my interest slowly shifted from traditional Engineering to Information Technology combined with Engineering.

<p>In this small-scale project, the task of coding the HTML page has been delegated to a single team member, utilizing VSCode as the primary development environment. As such, the audit trail primarily captures the progression of pushing the HTML file to the GitHub repository. In a larger project involving multiple teams and distinct coding parts, the audit trail would play a vital role in facilitating collaboration. Regular commits with meaningful messages would be essential, describing updates, resolving issues, introducing new features, and showcasing a collaborative workflow. Challenges encountered during development would be documented and addressed through commits, providing a comprehensive view of the project's evolution.
</p>
<h2>Part III: Project Description</h2>
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
<h4>Topic</h4>
<p>The proposed project aims to develop an automatic data collecting system for aquaculture ponds that will provide valuable information on water quality and pond conditions. This system will utilize IoT technology to monitor various parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, ammonia, and nitrate levels in real-time (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361447540_An_internet_of_things_labelled_dataset_for_aquaponics_fish_pond_water_quality_monitoring_system" target="_blank">Udanor et al. 2022</a>). By analyzing the collected data, the system will generate necessary feedback for farmers, including real-time pond situations, future pond condition forecasts, and guidance on maintaining the pond. This scientific approach to pond maintenance will ultimately enhance the efficiency of the aquaculture industry.</p>
The project will involve integrating multiple sensors into the aquaculture pond system to continuously monitor and record water quality parameters (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356464552_Overview_of_Smart_Aquaculture_System_Focusing_on_Applications_of_Machine_Learning_and_Computer_Vision" target="_blank">Vo et al. 2021</a>). These sensors will be connected to a data acquisition and processing system, which will be responsible for collecting, analyzing, and providing actionable insights to the farmers. The system will also leverage machine learning and computer vision te
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>The current absence of standardized pond monitoring protocols within the aquaculture industry fosters an environment of perilous ambiguity for farmers. Operating in a data vacuum, their decision-making regarding the aquatic health of their stock remains susceptible to misinterpretations and reactive interventions. This lack of proactive understanding directly contributes to the unfortunate reality of mass crustacean and fish mortalities, often stemming from undetected fluctuations in crucial water quality parameters. Consequently, these blind spots within the production chain perpetuate the existence of subpar aquaculture feed, optimized for hypothetical ideal conditions rather than tailored to the specific needs of diverse pond ecosystems. This detrimental cycle, driven by data paucity and inadequate feed formulations, not only jeopardizes the welfare of farmed aquatic animals but also poses a potential threat to consumer health. Hence, the development and implementation of standardized pond monitoring systems becomes an imperative not just for economic stability but also for ensuring the ethical and sustainable future of aquaculture.</p>
<h4>Landscape</h4>
<p>Currently, the Vietnamese aquaculture industry does not have readily accessible automated mechanisms for collecting information, as reported by reliable sources. There is currently no product available for purchase that is similar to this. While farmers have options like manual test kits or lab analysis, both suffer from drawbacks. Kits are labor-intensive and provide limited data, while labs offer slow turnaround and potentially inaccurate results. This leaves farmers struggling to fully grasp pond dynamics and make informed decisions. Existing tools exist for measuring individual pond parameters, but they operate in silos, failing to offer a holistic view or actionable insights. This is where our project offers a revolutionary leap forward. Our product automatically collects critical water values, analyzes them scientifically, and translates them into precise forecasts and practical advice for farmers. This real-time, integrated approach differentiates us from any existing options by empowering farmers with timely, data-driven insights for optimized pond management, a stark contrast to the fragmented and delayed information currently available.</p>
<h3>B. Aims</h3>
<h4>Aim:</h4>
<p>Our project aims to revolutionize Vietnam's aquaculture industry by empowering farmers with scientific knowledge, technology. We want to bridge the gap between traditional practices and cutting edge research equipping farmers with the tools and insights needed to optimize their operations, improve yield, and ensure sustainable growth.</p>
<h4>Justifications: </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Vietnam has ideal geographical conditions for aquaculture but traditional practices often face challenges such as inaccurate pond management, inefficient resource utilization. These can lead to lower productivity, environmental degradation and economic vulnerability. </li>
<li>Empowering farmers with scientific knowledge is crucial for addressing these challenges. By understanding the complex ecological dynamic of their pond and the principles behind sustainable aquaculture practices, farmers can make informed decisions, reduce risks, and maximize their productivity.</li>
<li>Technology and data-driven solutions can play a pivotal role in this transformation. Developing accurate measurement and forecasting standards, providing real-time monitoring tools, and leveraging weather data can empower farmers to optimize pond conditions, prevent disease outbreaks, and adapt to changing environmental factors.  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Goals:</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong><em>Standardizing for measurement and forecasting</em></strong>
      <p>Develop advanced water quality sensor and data analysis platform to monitor parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, ammonia, and nitrate levels in real-time. Establish standardized data collection protocols across farms, ensuring a reliable baseline for comparison and facilitating predictive modeling. By using a standard, we can ensure that everyone is using the same units of measurement and forecasting methods, which will make it easier to compare data and make informed decisions.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong><em>Empowering farmers with accurate tools</em></strong>
      <p>Assist farmers to optimize their production and reduce waste. By providing farmers with accurate tools, they can control the health of the fish and adjust their feed and water quality accordingly. This leads to healthier fish and increased yield.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong><em>Boosting South Vietnam’s aquaculture industry effectively</em></strong>
      <p>Collaborate with government agencies and industry leaders to develop and implement regional improvement plans targeting areas like feed optimization, disease prevention, and resource management. It will aid in increasing the profitability of the aquaculture industry in South Vietnam by improving efficiency; farmers can produce more fish with fewer resources, leading to reduced costs and boosted profits.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong><em>Improving the aquaculture medicine market</em></strong>
      <p>By providing unbiased information, farmers can choose the most effective medicine for their fish without being influenced by marketing or another bias. This helps farmers to make informed decisions about the medicine they use to treat their fish. Concurrently, we strive to enhance transparency and ethical standards within the market by advocating for more rigorous regulations and stringent quality control measures in the production and distribution of aquaculture medicines. In our commitment to promoting sustainable practices, we endorse alternative approaches to disease prevention and control, such as the use of probiotics and immunostimulants.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong><em>Collect different pond situations to better deal with abnormality</em></strong>
      <p>By collecting data from different pond situations, we can better acknowledge the cause of abnormality and develop strategies to prevent or mitigate them. This can be achieved by monitoring, observing, and recording key parameters and variables in aquaculture ponds, as well as analyzing the data to identify key patterns and trends. By collecting different pond situations and implementing these strategies, researchers and farmers can better deal with abnormalities in aquaculture ponds and ultimately improve the overall health and productivity of the aquaculture industry.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong><em>Connect with biologists and food engineers to reach a deeper scientific understanding of aquaculture</em></strong>
      <p>By connecting with experts in biology and food engineering, we can learn more about the biology of fish and the engineering of aquaculture systems, which will help us to develop more effective strategies for aquaculture. To achieve this goal, it is important to establish collaborations and partnerships with experts in the field of aquaculture. This can be done through various methods, such as attending conferences, workshops, and seminars, as well as networking with professionals in the field.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li><strong><em>Harnessing the power of weather prediction</em></strong>
      <p>Our initiative focuses on seamlessly incorporating comprehensive weather forecasts into advanced data analysis platforms, empowering farmers to foresee and address the implications of environmental shifts on pond conditions. By leveraging long-term weather trends, we aim to formulate climate-resilient aquaculture practices, ensuring the sustained operation of farms and minimizing losses during extreme weather events. Through strategic partnerships with weather forecast companies, we are working to develop customized, localized forecasts tailored to the specific needs of aquaculture. This collaborative effort is designed to equip farmers with actionable insights that go beyond conventional weather reports, enabling them to make informed decisions and implement adaptive strategies to safeguard their aquaculture operations effectively. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance the industry's resilience by integrating cutting-edge weather forecasting with sustainable aquaculture practices.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Our project’s goal is to improve aquaculture effectiveness by integrating detailed weather predictions into our advanced data analysis tools. By doing this, we aim to create localized forecasts that fit the specific needs of the aquaculture farmers regardless of where they are or what weather conditions they are in. We will collaborate with weather forecasting companies to this end. The ultimate objective of this is to empower farmers to protect their operations, make informed decisions to improve their yields even in extreme weather events.</p>
  <h3>C. Plans and Progress</h3>
  <p>Our project began when one of our teammates was researching the aquaculture situation in South Vietnam. He found out that farmers in South Vietnam still use primitive techniques to maintain their fish pond which is very ineffective and unreliable. From that observation, our teammate proposed to us his idea about an automatic aquaculture monitoring system. After careful thinking and evaluation, we pushed forward with the idea of a system that can automatically collect data from the fish’s ponds, analyze it and send feedback to the farmers using scientific methods. How the system works is that it will collect 2 most important variables in the fish’s pond: the pH level and the temperature level. After that, we will add additional theoretical conclusions and combine with on-site observation to determine the situation of the pond. <strong>This data collecting process will take roughly 8 to 10 weeks.</strong> </p>
  <p>The original idea for the project is that we will have 3 types of sensors to measure the fish’s pond condition, that is: pH, temperature and oxygen level. But after we did a lot of research, we came to a conclusion that have the oxygen level sensor included in the system is unfeasible because the production cost and maintenance cost is too high. Thus, our system will only have 2 types of sensors for the time being. Up until now, we are currently working on the software of the system. We decided that using Java would be the best coding language for the system because most of our teammates have experience with it. And for the microcontroller platform we decided to use Arduino due to its ease of use and compatibility with various sensors.
</p>
<p>For the hardware setup, we all agreed to use the Aqualine 10K Temperature Sensor from the Aqualine brand, assembled with an Arduino Uno and a pH sensor that has analog output. The sensor will be connected to the appropriate pins on the Arduino, and the system is powered with a stable power supply. A basic Arduino code was developed to read pH and temperature values from the sensors. The code included functions for reading analog signals from the pH sensor and digital temperature readings from the DS18B20 sensor. The Arduino was connected to a computer via USB, and the collected data was displayed on the Serial Monitor. This allowed for real-time monitoring of pH and temperature values.
</p>
<p>However, we have been facing a lot of challenges and dead-ends. One of our most difficult challenges right now is connecting with the farmers. Because farmers in South Vietnam are usually very conservative, they do not want strange things to be put in their fish’s pond so we had a hard time convincing farmers to use our system in the data collecting period. Right now, we have the lab testing environment but because the on-site environment is so much different so without a proper test field, it is hard to acquire meaningful data for our system.</p>
<p>Another big set back is that we do not have enough data to predict the longevity of our system. Naturally, when sensors are put into a hazardous environment, it will deteriorate and lose its accuracy. In order to prevent this, we can choose to use a more expensive and tougher sensor for the job but we soon realized it was impossible due to the total system production price being too high. Another way is that we figure out the deterioration rate of the sensor and react appropriately, either through adjusting the code to suit the deterioration rate of the system. This solution is the most sensible but because our system does not have enough on-site experience we can not give a precise result about the deterioration rate.  Under normal lab conditions, our sensor will start to deteriorate in about week 6 of constant exposure to the environment.
</p>
<p>We also discuss another solution is that based on the approximate sensor longevity in the lab condition, we will have members do the manual maintenance. This solution will be the most effective at keeping our system functional because we can check and clean every hazardous chemical the sensors have been exposed to. But this solution also comes with its own tremendous drawback that is manpower. In the lab environment, we should have enough members to do the maintenance consistently but when we try on-site testing, we are afraid we are shorted- staff to do maintenance for every machine in every pond. At the time being, we are still using this method because of its flexibility but in the future if we want to publish our system, we will have to think carefully about a more long-term solution.
</p>

</ul>
<h3>E. Scope and Limits </h3>
<p>Because of our limited time, our first version of the project will only be collecting 2 values in the pond and analyzing from there. This means that the system will only be able to collect and analyze two specific parameters of the pond are temperature and pH level. While this may provide some useful information about the pond, it is important to note that there are many other factors that can affect the health of the pond, such as dissolved oxygen levels, nutrient levels, and the presence of harmful bacteria or parasites. Therefore, the system's ability to provide a comprehensive analysis of the pond's health may be limited.</p>
<p>The system can give decently accurate information of the pond but there will still be a lot of abnormalities. While the system may be able to provide some useful information about the pond, it is important to note that there may be many abnormalities or irregularities that the system is not able to detect. For example, the system may not be able to detect the presence of certain types of harmful bacteria or parasites, or it may not be able to accurately measure certain parameters of the pond due to environmental factors such as weather conditions or water flow.
</p>
<p>
    The system then collects information about the abnormalities and analyzes why it happens. When the system detects an abnormality or irregularity in the pond, it will collect information about the specific issue and attempt to analyze why it is happening. This may involve collecting additional data about the pond, such as water samples or environmental data, and using this information to identify potential causes of the issue. However, the system's ability to accurately diagnose and address these issues may be limited by its data collection and analysis capabilities.
    </p>
<p>The more varied abnormalities and scenarios the system can collect, the better the prediction. As the system collects more data about the pond and the various abnormalities and scenarios that can occur, it will be able to improve its predictive capabilities. This means that the system will be better able to identify potential issues before they become serious problems, and provide more accurate recommendations for addressing these issues. Nevertheless, the system's ability to collect and analyze data may be limited by factors such as environmental conditions, equipment limitations, and data storage capacity.
</p>
<p>The feedback may not be real-time at the moment but rather report every 3 to 4 hours. While the system may be able to collect data in real-time, it may not be able to provide feedback to farmers in real-time. Instead, the system may report its findings every 3 to 4 hours, which may limit its usefulness in addressing urgent issues or emergencies. However, it is important to note that the system's reporting capabilities may be improved over time as the technology and infrastructure for real-time data transmission and analysis continue to develop.
</p>
<p>The feedback will be sent to the farmers via 3rd party software like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Zalo… Finally, it is important to note that the system's feedback will be sent to farmers via third-party software such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Zalo. While these platforms may be convenient and accessible for many farmers, they may also be subject to limitations such as connectivity issues, data privacy concerns, and compatibility issues with different devices and operating systems. Therefore, it is important to consider these factors when designing and implementing the system's feedback mechanisms.</p>
<h3>F. Tools and Technologies</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Java Script for web-based user interfaces and interaction with the cloud platform.
    </li>
    <li>Arduino is essential for interfacing with sensors and controlling hardware components in the pond system.
    </li>
    <li>Industrial Online PH Meter PH Controller ORP Sensor Electrode Probe Tester from Huaibei Huadian Automation Technology (China): Specific sensors for monitoring pH levels, oxidation-reduction potential, and other water quality parameters. 
    </li>
    <li>Aqualine 10K Temperature Sensor from Aqualine dedicated to measuring water temperature in the aquaculture pond.</li>
    <li>3D engineering design apps like: Blender, ANSYS, AutoCAD for creating models of the aquaculture system, aiding in planning and visual representation.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Team members as An with previous knowledge in JavaScript, C++, and Arduino can leverage their expertise in developing the system's software and firmware components. Experience with 3D engineering design applications (Blender, ANSYS, AutoCAD) can facilitate the creation of accurate models for the aquaculture system.
</p>
<h3>G. Testing</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Input important theoretical prediction into the system based on pH and Temperature</li>
    <li>Test the system function in a small aquarium to see if the system performs</li>
    <li>We can connect with 2 to 3 aquaculture farmers and ask their permission to use their pond for testing and data collecting purpose</li>
    <li>Important: To get a good database, the data collecting period should last around <strong>4 to 8 weeks</strong>, and the system result should be compared with <strong>on-site results every 2 days</strong></li>
    <li>Important: Due to the hazardous environment of the actual aquaculture pond, it is highly advised to have the sensor <strong>average longevity</strong>. This can be achieved by recording and comparing the value collected by the sensor and the actual value every 6 days. Implement changes to the sensor if the value is inaccurate or implement changes to the code to suit the actual scenario</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Every innovative solution demands an elaborate developing, experimenting and testing period to yield the most error-resistant product – our project is no different. After the completion of the code-writing phase, we will deploy the code onto the hardware to begin the testing phase. The first experimentation phase involves incorporating relevant theoretical predictions into the system based on pH and temperature parameters. Following this, we will assess the system’s functionality in a controlled environment, notably a small aquarium in a lab environment, to measure the performance of the system.
</p>
<p>After successful performance tests, we intend to approach around 2 to 3 aquaculture farmers, seeking permission to use their ponds for a more practical and comprehensive testing and data collection. Since gathering a robust database is a crucial aspect of the testing phase, we aim for the data collection period to be in a span of 4 to 8 weeks. Further, system results will be compared with on-site results every 2 days during this period as well.
</p>
<p>Acknowledging the hazardous environment existing in actual aquaculture ponds, it is imperative that we test and fine-tune the sensor’s average longevity too. To achieve this, a routine recording and comparison of sensor values against actual values will be conducted every 6 days. From these results, we will implement changes to the sensor if there are deviations in value accuracy, or make changes to the code to align with the practical pond scenario.

</table>
<h4>Overview of timeframe:</h4>
<p>Overall, in the first four weeks, our team will prioritize the development of the sensor system – specifically attempting to develop its code, hardware system, and integrating the software we built to the hardware to create a functional prototype, or a minimum viable product (MVP). As the table suggests, the development work is divided clearly among different members of the team, so that everyone has a part to play in the whole project. In the remaining weeks, we will conduct consistent testing in both a closed environment, and in actual aquaculture farms to determine key functionality issues with our MVP. From there we will adjust and adapt our MVP along the way, altering its code or reconsidering architecture design choices, until the system is mostly error-resistant. Finally, we will allocate some time for detailed project documentation so that another team who manages this project after us can clearly understand where we left off.
  It should be noted that this is an “expected” timeline, and may be subject to change or delays. Specifically, the coding and integration with the hardware phase (Week 1 to 3) might take longer than just 3 weeks as proposed, as problems relating to communication, or technical issues like persistent bugs in the code, might delay our development progress. In the data collection phase (Week 6 – Week 14), our team may struggle to arrange the logistics necessary in this stage (i.e. not being able to connect with farmers; not being able to transport required equipment to the testing site, etc.), which can delay the testing & adjustment timeline even further.
  </p>
<p>There can be numerous other unforeseen factors affecting our project execution timeline. To mitigate against these potential delays, our team will make sure to maintain constant and transparent communication and immediately address any issues that arise in either the development or testing phase. In addition, we will also cooperate closely with our project stakeholders, requesting them for technical support to mitigate against possible issues.</p>

<h3>I.Risks</h3>
<p>Upon assessing our project and its potential risks, several issues have emerged notably. Firstly, the underlying complex nature of the pond creates challenges for the sensor system to accurately diagnose and categorize abnormalities in farmers’ ponds. This makes the sensor system vulnerable to providing inaccurate or only partially accurate information, due to the intricacies involved. To mitigate this, our team can extend the data collection period to increase the variety of scenarios the system encounters, effectively training the system to be smarter to deal with anomalous situations.</p>
<p>The stability and safety of the sensor is also susceptible to the often toxic environment of the pond. The hazardous nature of the pond leads to decreased lifespan for the sensors, leading to potential system instability. This risk will be inevitable, however solutions to this are simple. In the initial phases, we will conduct highly frequent manual maintenance, record average longevity of the sensors and improve these deficiencies early on.</p>
<p>Moreover, the typical conservative mindset of many Vietnamese farmers also poses an additional layer of risk. For a long time, farmers are often skeptical if not resistant to new technologies that disrupt their long-standing practices of manually monitoring their fish ponds. This skepticism was further exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in massive drops of aquaculture sales, making farmers less likely to invest in technologies that help streamline and enhance their quality of work. To tackle this concern, we may explore the option of improving our system’s User Interface, making it more easy and intuitive for farmers to use, making them less resistant to these sophisticated tgiut</p>
<h3>J.Group processes and communications </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Our group will mostly be communicating via online means. This is to optimize the time spent for building the actual product itself, coding & testing, instead of wasting time on commutes for frequent face-to-face meetings. However, there will be exceptions, where there will be meetings about hardware related discussions, where actual demo testing of the hardware is required. </li>
    <li>Online communication will be especially crucial during the testing phase, where our team will split up to conduct tests at farmers ponds. Due to geographical challenges, having online meetings will be vital for our group’s convenience, efficiency and effectiveness.
    </li>
    <li>During the initial phases of the project, from Week 1 to Week 4, our meetings will be conducted at highly frequent intervals. This is because we will be designing codes, building the hardware and integrating the software with hardware, and this process necessitates constant feedback and adjustments, and clear and consistent communication to ensure a smooth development workflow. It is expected we will be meeting at a minimum frequency of around 4-5 meetings per week. These meetings could range from online joint coding sessions or code review, architecture and design discussions or problem-solving brainstorming.
    </li>
    <li>However, at later stages, notably during Week 5 to Week 14, our group’s meetings will be much more loosened, due to this phase mostly being about data collection and constant analysis, which could be done without the need for excessive meetings. We expect that these meetings will occur at minimum 1-2 online meetings per week to discuss our data findings together, and make adjustments to our project where necessary.
    </li>
    <li>In terms of communication channels, our originally thought of paid platforms to create a professional environment, but due to budget constraints, we are considering free alternatives. For team meetings, our team prefers to use Microsoft Teams which is provided exclusively for free for RMIT students, with full features. As for formal project communications, our team will use a platform called “Slack”, which is a cloud-based collaboration platform to streamline communication and enhance teamwork within organizations. We found that Slack was intuitive to use, commonly used by IT professionals in the workplace, and offers basic functions like messaging, file sharing, project planning, and tools integration, for free. For informal conversations between team members (like settling on a meetup place, sharing useful information to each other, etc.), we will use Facebook’s Messenger.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What happens if a team member does not respond to communications?</h4>
<ul>
    <li><p>One of the most striking causes of ineffective communications (and hence, member unresponsiveness) in teams is having <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.trinet.com/insights/poor-communication" target="_blank">unclear objectives & roles</a>.</p></li>
<li>To mitigate this, in our team’s initial meeting, we will set clear project objectives, define clear scope and limits, map out a coherent execution timeline with clear phases and measurable objectives, which are then delegated fairly among members of the team.</li>
<li>We will also together set clear working expectations, ensuring everyone understands the required work ethic, and the expected number of meetings that our team should have.</li>
<li>These measures will help ensure an effective communication environment where our team members are enabled to contribute, deterring unresponsiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>However, if we implemented these prevention tactics, but a member still does not respond, we will: </em>  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Try communicating with the team member via another channel like text messaging, phone call, sID email, or attempt contacting that member’s acquaintances for assistance.</li>
<li>In the worst case, we will seek support from either RMIT lecturers or contacting the school to help us get in contact with that member.</li>
<li>In the worst case, the member in question chose to intentionally ignore communications. If this happens, we will suspend this person from the team, and our team will have a follow-up meeting to rearrange the scope of work and responsibilities of the remaining members.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part IV: Skills and Jobs</h2>
<p>A strong team whose vision and purpose algins, coupled with the right expertise, is unstoppable. The same is true with scaling our project as well. If approached by venture capitalists with the offer to further develop this project, we need to assemble new roles with new expertise and talents. It should be noted that realistically we would need more than a team of four, but if we had to strictly choose four, then we would desire to have the following roles to our project:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The “Finance Specialist”</strong></li>
<li><strong>The “Business Development Specialist”</strong></li>
<li><strong>The “Aquaculture Biologist”</strong></li>
<li><strong>The “Technical Specialist”</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>1.The Finance Specialist (FS)</h3>
<p>The FS role is the nearest scope of work to what is commonly the “CFO” or “Chief Financial Officer”. This role in general will help our project with financial planning, reporting and analysis, and ensuring the appropriate use of resources in the project. In startups, CFOs often play a crucial role in fundraising, helping to instill investor confidence, by helping to gather critical information about the organization, and providing income and expenditure projections. CFOs in typical startups also work tirelessly to provide the leadership team with vital information, to help the rest of the team make informed, cautious and strategic decisions. This applies also to our project, where the finance specialist will also play a pivotal role in the scaling of our project, by assuming similar responsibilities.</p>
<p>
    The FS in our team has to be someone careful and conscientious. The person also has to be highly analytical, and has to possess a strategic and calculating mindset. These traits will help the FS think logically about the project’s resources and expenses, help him/her work effectively with large quantities of data and complex information, and help this person think about both the short-term and long-term resource needs of the project. An FS who has all of these traits, will undoubtedly help our project scale smoothly.
    </p>
<p>In terms of technical expertise, we researched that a finance specialist with an “ACCA” certificate (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) is sufficient for our project. Obtaining the ACCA requires a deep comprehension of theoretical finance concepts and proficiency in finance-related skills such as financial modeling, data analysis, valuation, accounting, and risk management – which is highly required for our project and for dealing with venture capitalists. Other certifications exist such as the CFA or CPA, but in our group’s opinion, these certifications demand very high compensation, which is not feasible for our project.</p>
<h3>2.Business Development Specialist (BDS)
</h3>
<p>The Business Development Specialist will have the highest set of responsibilities in the entire project, similar to how a “CEO” or “Chief Executive Officer” has the highest leadership authority in a large organization. This specialist needs to be capable in various aspects of business including management, finance, and market strategy.
</p>
<p>On a general level, the BDS will have the highest responsibility for handling internal and external affairs of this project in the scaling phase. When rapidly expanding an IT project, four stakeholders emerge as the most important:<strong> the internal team, customers, partners and investors.
</strong></p>
<p>Internally, the BDS will oversee the project’s overall management, ensuring the team effectively executes on the tasks that aligns with the team’s objectives in a disciplined and timely manner. This person is also responsible for aligning incentives between other personnel to properly motivate and push the entire project team. </p>
<p>Externally, this role is in charge of conducting market research, to gauge the market’s (i.e. aquaculture farmers) demand levels, or to find new markets that the project can penetrate into. The BDS is held accountable for selling the project idea to customers too. This role is also responsible for forming strategic partnerships that accelerates the project’s growth, and help connect the project with potential investors and venture capitalists to fundraise for the project’s initial and growth stages. </p>
<p>In short, the BDS needs to possess a rich understanding of business, to efficiently and effectively manage the internal team well, and profitably engage external connections.
</p>
<p>In terms of characteristics, our team needs a BDS who is strategic, visionary, charismatic, and has a deep understanding of market dynamics. Being strategic is crucial to any top leadership position, as people often follow these insights from the top leader. This type of leader has to have charisma, as it often attracts and compels people to work for the project, or for the leader themselves. He/she also needs to comprehend the market well, grasping core pain points, and intuit when an opportunity arises in the marketplace to capitalize on. All of these traits make for a powerful leader, capable of expanding the project to the next level.</p>
<p>In terms of technical expertise required, our team figured that someone with a degree like “Bachelor of Business Management” with a few years of prior work-leadership experience is sufficient for our project’s needs. Someone with this certificate and this level of experience should have a reasonable understanding of business strategies, market dynamics, management frameworks, financial statements,... to help scale our project. We had considered those with MBAs or Masters of Business Administration as the much better alternative for hiring, but those with this degree demand very high compensation, which would be unaffordable and unnecessary for our project.
</p>
<h3>3.
    Aquaculture Biologist (AB)
    </h3>
    <p>During and after the process of creating the system, the Aquaculture Biologist plays a crucial role in inputting and updating the system with accurate scientific theories and giving examples about the pond’s values data analysis to the system so that the system can start producing appropriate analysis and prediction. The AB is also responsible for acknowledging any abnormalities about the pond’s condition and providing appropriate predictions to the system to combat it when it occurs. 
    </p>
    <p>In terms of characteristics, since our AB would need to be on-site a lot of the time for observing and comparing if the pond’s condition is aligned with the system prediction and working with the IT specialist to transform the scientific information into the system data, our team needs an AB who is quite out-going, cooperative and have physical . The AB should also have good Analytical Skills, Problem-Solving Abilities and Environmental Awareness.  Having good Analytical Skills will increase the strength in interpreting data related to water quality, fish health, and environmental conditions. Problem-Solving Abilities to identify issues within aquaculture systems and develop effective solutions and Environmental Awareness for understanding of environmental impacts and a commitment to sustainable and responsible aquaculture practices.
    </p>
    <p>In terms of technical expertise required, our team reckons someone that has knowledge in Aquaculture Biology, Water Quality Management, Pathology and Health Management and Aquatic Ecology. Aquaculture Biology for in-depth knowledge of fish biology, physiology, and behavior to optimize conditions for growth and health. Water Quality Management to have the expertise in monitoring and managing water quality parameters, including pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen levels. Pathology and Health Management for understanding of fish diseases, parasitology, and health management practices within aquaculture. And Aquatic Ecology for the knowledge of aquatic ecosystems and their interactions to promote a balanced and sustainable environment.</p>
<h3>4.IT Specialist (ITS)</h3>
<p>Just like the Aquaculture Biologist, the IT Specialist also plays an important role during and after the process of creating the system. The ITS is responsible for creating the sensor hardware for the fish’ pond, creating and code for the sensor hardware, creating the code for the main system and creating a communication channel between the main system and the sensor hardware. ITS is also responsible for transforming the scientific knowledge from the AB into the main system hardware and main system maintaining and updating.
</p>
<p> In terms of characteristics, our ITS should have Problem-Solving Skills, Adaptability, Team Collaboration and Client-Focused Approach. Problem-Solving Skills for strong analytical and problem-solving abilities to address technical challenges and optimize system performance. Adaptability to adapt to evolving technologies and the specific needs of the aquaculture industry. Team Collaboration to collaborate with interdisciplinary teams, including AB, BDS and FS. And Client-Focused Approach to have a customer-focus mindset to understand and address the needs of end-users, aquaculture managers, and stakeholders.
</p>
<p>In terms of technical expertise required, our team reckons someone that has knowledge in Programming Languages, Database Management, Web Development, Data Analytics and Mobile Application Development. Programming Languages for the proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, or C++ for developing and maintaining software components of the monitoring system. Database Management for the expertise in database design and management (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to store and retrieve sensor data efficiently. Data Analytics for the proficiency in data analytics tools to analyze historical data trends, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights for aquaculture management. And Mobile Application Development in order to develop mobile app (iOS, Android) for creating a user-friendly mobile interface to access the aquaculture monitoring system remotely.
</p>
<h2>Part V: Group Description</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Nguyễn Mạnh Dũng  </strong>
        <p>Overall, I was impressed with how my team members finished their assigned work on time and with very clear efforts put into the quality of the work. This assignment punctuality was also coupled with efficient working habits as well. Over the course of this assignment, our team had a total of three meetings, all of which were conducted effectively and efficiently, and everyone walked out of the meetings with clear roles and responsibilities. The meetings were succinct, efficient, but sufficient, which increased our productivity by allowing more time to focus on the actual assignment work itself.</p>
        <p>An aspect of assignment work we could have enhanced was communicating expectations more clearly. There were parts of the assignments which we did not define clearly what we expected of each other in terms of how long or how well-polished our paragraphs should be, or how detailed should certain parts be. This resulted in us having to fix things back and forth, which caused a few instances of unwanted delays. In the future, we will be sure to pinpoint these expectations clearly earlier so our assignments could be done more smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
            A surprising insight we got during our teamwork was we found out that the higher one climbs the IT ladder, the less technical skills matter but the more interpersonal skills are emphasized.
            </p>
        <p>During the project, particularly while we did the “Skills and Jobs” part we consulted with an IT professional to understand more about the inner-workings of the IT industry. This person commented to us that the higher the IT/Technical roles get, like Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), or Engineering Director, the less these roles need to code and get their hands directly involved in development projects. The higher these roles get, the higher priority is placed on management, leadership, communication, sales and time management skills – the typical skills required for any leadership position.
        </p>
        <p>This goes against our previous assumptions that the higher IT roles are, the more advanced an IT professional technical skills has to become. But in reality, top-tier leaders are often not the most intelligent, but are often those who can assemble and work with and lead intelligent minds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout this assignment, I learned that in any group dynamic there will always be people with different traits and personalities, and often with different needs and expectations. The job of the whole team, and importantly for the leader, is to align these differences and varying demands together appropriately, to keep the whole team functioning toward the objective. Sometimes, this alignment process might mean that leaders or members make compromises for the greater good of the team.
            </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Võ Hoàng Nhân</strong>
    <p>Reflecting on our group's performance during this assignment period, several positive aspects stand out. Our communication and collaboration were strong, evident in the timeframe table . We maintained a clear focus on our goals, ensuring everyone was aligned with the project's objectives. The most challenging aspect I encountered was learning how to create a website using HTML code—a completely new experience for me. Fortunately, HTML proved to be the easiest concept to learn and acquire. Despite the initial challenge, the simplicity of HTML facilitated my understanding and allowed me to swiftly acknowledge the fundamentals of web development. Throughout this experience, I learned that a successful group requires a balance of structure and adaptability. Flexibility in responding to challenges fosters resilience, while clear communication and defined roles provide a solid foundation. Overall, this assignment highlighted the importance of both individual accountability and collaborative problem-solving in achieving successful outcomes.


    </p>
    <li><strong>Nguyễn Văn Ngọc Thành </strong>
    <p>Through the project, several positive aspects stood out. Our group discussions were particularly effective, with team members consistently completing their tasks on time, fostering a harmonious environment without any conflicts. This cohesion contributed to the overall success of the project. However, one area that could be improved is the frequency of our meetings. While our discussions were productive, meeting more often could enhance communication and collaboration, ensuring everyone stays informed and aligned. A surprising challenge arose when we discovered that our video presentation required a reel format, and none of us had prior knowledge of video editing. Despite the initial setback, the team quickly adapted, learning and collaborating to produce an attractive and effective video in a short timeframe. Personally, I gained valuable insights into coding, an area not within my comfort zone. Engaging in the project required me to understand coding tools, demonstrating the importance of diverse skills within a group dynamic. Overall, the experience highlighted the significance of effective communication, adaptability, and continuous learning within a group setting. 
    </p></li>
    <li><Strong>Phạm Lê Việt An</Strong>
    <p>After finishing the project with the group, I have experienced many positive elements. Our team members have a very high standard of professionalism and always aim to create the best result. Our team is also very clear in communicating with each other so every step in the project is done relatively smoothly. Overall, this level of dedication, clear communication and commitment makes the final result of our project much better than what we initially anticipated.
    </p>
  <p>One aspect that I think could be improved is that we should have more conversation between members, our team meetings are very productive so I wish we could be discussing more often to enhance the technical ceiling of our project</p></li>
<p>One thing that I did not expect was our project presentation. We are required to illustrate our project in the TikTok and Reel style with quick and engaging content which some of us do not have experience in. But thanks to our team's collaborative effort, we quickly learn and adapt from each other and produce a quality result.</p>
<p>When working with the team, I have learnt a lot about our team's manner of professionalism. From this project, I acknowledge the importance of clear communication and how it can significantly increase the productivity of the team.</p>
